title: '#840: Bill Gurley — Investing in The AI Era, 10 Days in China, and Important
  Life Lessons from Bob Dylan, Jerry Seinfeld, MrBeast, and More'
pub_date: '2025-12-17'
summary: 'In this wide-ranging conversation, Tim Ferriss interviews Bill Gurley, general
  partner at Benchmark Capital and author of "Running Down a Dream: How to Thrive
  in a Career You Actually Love." The discussion begins with topical issues around
  AI, with Gurley explaining that technological waves and financial bubbles come as
  a pair - real innovation inevitably attracts speculators and "carpet baggers." He
  warns retail investors about the current AI investment landscape, particularly questionable
  SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) deals, while noting that institutional investors have
  zero interest in non-AI deals currently. However, he emphasizes that regardless
  of one''s field, everyone should be actively experimenting with AI tools to remain
  competitive and find the intersection of AI capabilities with deep domain expertise.


  Gurley shares insights from his recent 10-day trip to China, challenging common
  American misconceptions about the country. He explains that China operates more
  through competitive provincial systems than top-down communist control, leading
  to intense innovation and remarkable execution in industries like solar, EVs, and
  robotics. He toured Xiaomi''s car factory and was impressed by their systematic
  approach to product development and manufacturing efficiency. Gurley argues that
  American policy discussions about China are often based on misunderstandings of
  what''s actually happening there, and warns that the U.S. faces significant challenges
  in manufacturing cost competitiveness and infrastructure development speed.


  The conversation transitions to Gurley''s book, which provides a framework for pursuing
  non-traditional career paths. Key principles include: going where the action is
  (physical proximity to industry centers still matters despite digital tools), embracing
  peers for shared learning, and ensuring genuine passion through the "free time learning"
  test - if you wouldn''t study something in your spare time, you''re probably not
  truly passionate about it. Gurley shares compelling stories from figures like Jerry
  Seinfeld, Bob Dylan, and restaurateur Danny Meyer, all of whom gained deep foundational
  knowledge before innovating. He concludes by discussing his next chapter: potentially
  starting a policy institute called P3 (Purpose, Progress, Prosperity) focused on
  issues like regulatory capture, intellectual property reform, and financial market
  fairness, using data and transparency to drive systemic change.'

Hello boys and girls ladies and germs this is Tim Ferriss welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show where's my job to deconstruct world class performers. I interviewed them to tease out the habits routines frameworks etc that you can apply to your own lives my guest today is bill girly he is a general partner benchmark a leading venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. But his venture career his career overall spans a lot he is invested in and serve on the boards of such companies is next door open table stitch fix uber and Zillow earned his bachelor of science degree in computer science from the University of Florida and then his MBA from the University of Texas at Austin he's had. Lots of other careers but we discussed that in our first episode we're going to cover a lot more in this one for more than two decades bill has written about technology and other subjects. On his popular blog above the crowd and on his social media accounts his new book is running down a dream how to thrive in a career you actually love and we detail exactly what he means by that including some incredible stories and take ways that you can apply you can find him on exit x.com b girly g r l e y. And without further do please enjoy a very wide ranging conversation with another than bill girly. This is how to do like in one flat out for a half mile before my hands start to shake. And I also request. Now it is in the past. I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue of a metal and the sky. The. The. The. The. The. Bill. Good to see you man good to see you and I thought we would start with a prop that you brought so there's a very thick book the tattered cover. And I think that is as good a lead in as anything and what are you holding. I'm holding a book called the last laugh by Phil Berger the reason is tatters I think it may be out of print like I bought it used. You know because I wanted to see it and have it. What's the subtitle? The last lap the world of stand up comics. Why do you have this book are you thinking of making a career switch? No, no, no, no, no. So as part of researching my new book running down a dream my co-writer and I were we spent six years like just diving through stories because I had done this speech at the University of Texas and we wanted to enhance it. You know when we went to the printed form and one of the stories we came across was Jerry Seinfeld and his decision to pursue a career as a comedian and he was in New York. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do with his life. He had an inkling an inkling that he might want to be a stand up comic but he didn't know what that meant. He didn't know if it was a real career. He didn't know that you could make money and he read this book and it profiles looks like 15 different. It's got Woody Allen bill Cosby George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, Robert Klein. It profiled them in a way. It was very disinhibiting to him. It gave him permission to go do this career that's not a typical career. When you go to college they don't list stand up comedian as something that you can go do. The guidance counselors generally putting that on the multidactress. Exactly but this book served as something that granted him permission to go do that. We're going to come back to that. I will say that I bookmark this for future conversations and of course we're chatting outside of these recordings but because two years ago almost exactly when we did our first episode you mentioned that you were working on a book idea. Based on the belief that it's easier than ever to rise up because access to mentors and information is unprecedented. We'll come back to that of course and discuss it and the frameworks and the approaches and the stories at some length but I wanted to start with some topical subject matter. AI bubble or not. If so what does that mean? I think this is a super interesting partner Peter reminded me of a book that we had seen a while ago by Carlotta Perez. It has this very benign title technological revolutions and financial capital. It was written in like 2002 and what Perez kind of simplifies and notices which I just find perfect for trying to understand whether there's a bubble or not is that every time there's been a technology wave that's been a huge that leads to wealth creation especially fast wealth creation that will inherently invite speculators carpet baggers interlopers that want to come take advantage of think of the gold rush. And so people want to make it a debate do you believe in a I or is it a bubble and if you say you think it's a bubble they say oh you don't believe in a I like this got you kind of thing. And if you study Perez and I think this is absolutely correct. If the wave is real then you're going to have bubble like behavior they come together as a pair precisely because any time there's very quick wealth creation you're going to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So you get a flood of those types of people coming at it. It's hard. There's a real technology wave that's fundamentally changing the world and there's also massive speculation simultaneously. Yeah they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago maybe two weeks ago saw short interview with your friend Jeff Bezos and he distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles. And cited and I'm paraphrasing here but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble. I financial bubble versus let's just say the early 2000s like 98 99 2000 where a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the fact it created new generations of entrepreneurs and a lot of economic growth. And he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category of things. But I suppose given that the dancing pair you described come together. How would you think about investing in private companies modern venture capital at this point in time and just I suppose as it's changed since you were most active. Just a quick comment on that industrial bubble thing. You know one thing that is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave. The big players even the Mac 7 have all decided to do things from a deal perspective you've read about these circular deals and whatnot. Could you explain what you mean by that? Yeah I mean there's a lot of talk out there but it all started when Microsoft invested in Open AI Open. I agreed to buy services from Microsoft which is called a circular deal because you're giving them money they wouldn't have otherwise. And when Dario was on stage at Deal Book last week he said oh I can explain this is not that hard. Amazon wanted us to spend money we didn't have so they gave us even more money and I'm like well that's precisely why this is a question of behavior. But it's gotten bigger you know in videos handing out money and then Nvidia gave core weave money but then also agreed to buy any services they have left over. This stuff's not ideal like if you were to say what's Chris clean accounting you know you wouldn't do these kind of things and some of them say well it's not material in which I would say well then why are you doing it. And I've asked other people to try and understand how even big sophisticated companies might get speculative using a word from the previous discussion and you know I hear things like well loss aversion tends to go down when you're winning like if you're on a hot streak in a casino you take more risk. Things like that but it is surprising to me so when it comes to retail investors I would be particularly concerned for them at this stage in the AI game because there is a plethora of SBV vehicles you've heard that phrase I'm sure SBV is where someone has an end on an investment and they do a one off VC fund if you want to see this vehicle. Yeah it's a single entity just for that one to invest in acts we have an allocation of however much money and then they can allow sort of Jane Doe and John Doe potentially. They take a rake on it and there's people promoting SBV's in situations where they don't even actually have the underlying stock or maybe they hope to get it. It's the wild wild west and most of the people on that edge I would put in the category of interloper carpet bagger these are people that have come to this thing. I just think you got to be quite careful the investments that were made that have already had 100x plus returns were made a while ago you know before this thing started. That's not to say there won't be an incremental AI investment that makes money I think there will but you're odds right now of that being the case are really really low. Yeah I would add to that and say this applies to me as much as anyone else but your actual risk tolerance may differ probably does differ significantly from your perceived risk tolerance if you haven't had a huge drawdown right if you haven't actually written a few of those waves and see how you respond. And those circumstances and you should be as close skeptical of how you view your own intestinal fortitude with some of those things or maybe the losses you can absorb. I recall for instance I've seen this many many times but with these types of SBV's people get involved and let's just say they're not typically an angel investor they don't have the experience of watching 60 70 80% of their investments go to zero or become the walking dead. And they sign off on all of the not necessarily waivers but they accept accept accept like the SBV terms of service which all say you could lose all of your investment this is incredibly risky. But then when it does go to zero the financial and psychological impact is catastrophic. There's a lot of people and I think this comes from a very good place I think they're very well intentioned who look at the world and say rising inequality like why can't everyone have access to the same things and then companies are staying private longer so they say we need to institutionalize the generic public's ability to invest in private companies. I think there's two problems one you just handed out which is most private company VC backed even go to zero like the majority which is not something people they sense that they want the lottery ticket they want the Uber they want the one that goes to the moon. But they don't understand that that comes along with it they don't buy losing lottery tickets for 12 years right right exactly and the second problem is the information transparency in the private company game is just low and I think the institutional investors have come to understand that and kind of know what they're getting into and know how to evaluate things but if you come at it with a public market mindset thinking oh every set of financials I've been handed is audited and is correct and that's just not the case it's super loosey goosy. So if you were this may be a difficult question but if you were angel investing right now how would you be thinking about your approach. I'll tell you funny story when I decided to hang up my gloves if you will and stop making institutional venture capital investments I had a whole bunch of ideas about what I wanted to do next and one of them was all do a bunch of angel investing you know Bezos did it on the side you know this would be fantastic pretty well but I was explaining this to a I won't say who it is but a Silicon Valley CEO very successful and he said what are you going to do now I said I was thinking I'd do an angel investing goes why would you do that he said I got 50 of these things like people don't return my calls because I wish I'd never done it so there's a unglamorous side to it as much as there is a glamorous side and you've participated in it what would I say I think if I were doing angel investments I'd try and find him an intersection of people that are super curious and are playing with all these AI tools but bring a perspective from a particular industry that gives them an advantage in that area where they could simultaneously be maybe the smartest user of AI in their genre so despite the or maybe because of because we talked about the pair the AI bubble you would still be looking at AI intersected opportunities if you're angel investing yeah there's a weird reality out there right now and if this could end if ever a bubble is popped or whatever but the institutional investors have zero interest in non-AID deals zero it's more black and white than I could be successful and for people who do not know the term define the institutional investor people who are paid both a salary and a piece of the return to be active investors of other people's money using other people's money but the reason that kind of matters is if you angel fund a deal and have any hope of it raising money in the future if it's not AI related right now could dive neglect there is no interest I can't state clearly enough out there's zero interest and I can't believe that there's no interest in the future. Clearly enough out there's zero and I could simultaneously make fun of that reality but I could also justify that reality but it is the reality right now and by the way while I mentioned that I feel obligated for your audience like I don't care what field you're in you should be playing with this stuff. It has the potential to impact your role in your career and the best way to protect against any risk of your career being obfuscated or eliminated from a i is to be the most a i enabled version of yourself you can possibly be. Just a quick thanks to our sponsors and will be right back to the show. So our place reached out to me as a potential sponsor and the first thing I did was look at the reviews their products and said send me one and that is the titanium always pan pro and the claim is that it's the first non stick pan was zero coding so that means zero forever chemicals and durability that will last forever. I was very skeptical i was very busy so i said you know what i want to test the same quickly test with two things i test it with scrambled eggs in the morning. And then i test it with a steaks here and it worked perfectly in both cases and the design is really clever does combine the best qualities of stainless steel cast iron and non stick into one product. And now our place is expanding this first of its kind technology to their titanium pro cookware sets which are made in limited quantities so if you're looking for non toxic long lasting pots and pans that outperform everything else in your kitchen just head to our place.

How would you think about maybe you can give a hypothetical example of looking for someone who has very very sophisticated domain expertise. An experience is now intersecting with a I and has a unique. Because of the combination perspective on things to invest in as an angel investor separate that from something that's just going to be consumed by the fundamental. Models and these larger companies that from a career perspective or. From an angel investment perspective how would you pick folks you don't think are just going to end up working on something that gets replicated in short order by the bigger companies. The key is just to stay. Pretty far away from the edge of whatever you can go online and see interviews with people in anthropica open a eye and what they're working on like if it's the next thing they're going to do. I don't think you're going to be protected but as I think about founders and angel investors you're talking about a pretty broad array of things at this point as I mentioned earlier you're not going to back the next big model company besides if you were you need a billion dollars. Angel investment to go make that happen the games change there's so much money involved I think you're going to want to be off the beaten path anyway when I think about these deeper verticals I don't think it will make sense for. Open a eye to go crush every little vertical waste management even if the models capable of understanding that subject matter there are workflows there are data sets that are local to your customer. And that has stuff has to be stitched together so I think having an understanding of. A particular industry and one that's not going to be on the next thing to do list that open a eye would probably your best bet got it so is it fair to say from understanding correctly that effectively looking for something that would not be a high priority for one of these larger companies and also proprietary data set of some time. Prior to your data sets the more kind of workflows that exist are better because you can build software around those things. What is the workflow the thing to pop them my head on the board of Zillow Zillow's been investing for the past five years in tools that help the realtor do their day to day job they have a tool called showing time that helps you book in person. Toers that houses as an example like there's putting the mortgage together getting the sign off son like there's just all these tasks that have to be happened that can be automated and so. Task that can be automated that can be integrated with a eye the more of that stuff you can build into a system. The better off you're going to be protecting yourself from a model that just answers questions which is why I brought it up to move on to. Big topic big country China you spent 10 days there over the past summer. What was your experience what did you see what made an impression what did you do. I've been about. Six times before so this is like my seventh trip. This is one thing that was different my daughter is Asian studies major as you were. And she spent the summer in Hong Kong so we picked her up and then we toured six cities in 10 days. And my objective with this trip in the past trips it was mostly just to meet with entrepreneurs and founders and mutual sharing of information that kind of thing. This time I was more interested in just kind of being eyes wide open and learning and so we took two of the high speed trains you know just as an experience that. I got a tour of the Xiaomi factory with their new car the issue seven and was trying to get a feel for. What's kind of most recent there and we you know what the shins and the overnight city which is gone from. I think less than a hundred thousand people in 1982 20 million people. Just to see the scale and scope of the whole thing there's a lot of rhetoric in the US about what is or isn't happening in China. And I just wanted to have a better feel for and we're making policy decisions that are going to. Impact the global footprint and God forbid you know end up in a World War three kind of situation. So anyway I just want to better understanding I was aided by the fact that. Dan Wong shared his book breakneck with me right before I left and I read it while I was there which was interesting and then it came out and of course it ended up on the bestseller list. But I think it's miss perceived I think China's misperceived in a lot of ways. What are some of those misperceptions the biggest one is. That people who have a rudimentary understanding of. What is happening there is this word communism to infer a lot of other things and one of the things that's inferred by communism is top down state run. System I think they think of Russia and they assume well that always lead to bad capital allocation no innovation because they have this picture. In their mind of I don't know like brick buildings with snow all around them and not much happening and the reality there is just far far different from that. I think Dan Wong did a great job of explaining how. The country puts out this five year plan but then the provinces which are. They're a lot bigger than a US state but they're the equivalent like the town of the country segment and they compete with each other. And the effective mayor of the province if he does well has a chance to move up in the system which is not a reality in the US system. But what that leads to is just a massive amount of competition. What are the metrics by which they're being judged to give any idea on a province level is it some equivalent of GDP it's not the right term but. I'm guessing probably like we could go talk to a I get a better answer than I have right now yeah I would think that's part of it prosperity employment. Those kind of things by the way this. Provincial competition is also led to overbuild the buildings like it's not always positive you know bridges that aren't used there's a. Go cities go cities yes but. You end up with hyper competition so I think the thing that a lot of people in Silicon Valley. Love about capitalism is this notion of the invisible and and. Competition that leads to innovation and best practice and the winners rise up and they're better for it that is happening there and if you read about the solar industry or the EU industry or. Now the robotics industry they have hundreds of different companies competing in these fields and it's brutal competition and as a result of that they're ending up with. Very innovative companies which once again I think people wouldn't prescribe to being possible in a communist world and remarkable. Execution from a industrial standpoint so the price points of the products that will be sold around the globe are well below anything that could be done. How do you go about getting a tour of show me fact I would think that they would be. Very close about that I don't know if you saw this going around yesterday but they shipped a car to this youtuber oh yeah I saw it. Which is brilliant and that's the issue seven that's the factory I went to as I mentioned I've been there before so I met ladies you. Who's the founder of Xiaomi in 2005 when he was chairman of Joe which was a. He commerce company Amazon bought so he's been around a while he has evolved into the best thing I. It says like he's the Steve jobs of China right now when you quit doing Joe and he had this other company as well he declared. Ten years ago he's going to build a smartphone just out of the blue I'm going to build a smartphone he didn't have any smart phone experience but jalmy is now the third largest manufacturer of handsets in the globe and about. Four or five years ago at about the exact same time Apple and a day we're interested in building a car he said I'm going to build a car. Well not only do you say I'm going to build a car but that was a response to sanctions right it was an emergency I listen to one of the translation of even though my Chinese is decent but it's not. As good as it was was his is twenty twenty four that's it company wide address we talked about. Sanctions coming in saying what if we couldn't make. Phones what we do but that talk is unbelievable it's translated on youtube and I would encourage people to watch from about minute thirty to about a minute fifteen or an hour fifteen. Which is where he talks about his process for designing the car i don't know if you saw that yeah i did. But it's crazy he says he put a note on any car in his parking lot that he had never drove and he would [ADVERTISEMENT WAS REMOVED]t[ADVERTISEMENT WAS REMOVED] there's a saying. I think i heard while i was over there don't be the tallest tree. Yeah this is a don't be the tallest tree. The other nail sticks out gets hammered down in japan they have a totally different system obviously the other entrepreneur. Outside of the june is the by dance CEO. And by dance is probably got the leading position for the consumer a i like open a i but over there right now in addition to. Just incredible revenue growth is the company that own tiktok and what not but they're not going public and you don't see him at all which may get to the stall tree thing. Yeah i mean celebrities also disappear over there no very mysteriously yes well and business people. So yes that does happen. I will say and for people who are wondering because there are a lot of. Should we put this i mean there are people who are very angry very hawkish some people are very very supportive and then their agendas or alliances get questioned. I like you just interested in understanding what is happening to the extent that i can what is the actual. Truth on the ground what do the details and frankly i mean the innovation over there is remarkable and what they've done in terms of. Establishing access to rare metals and everything they need to manufacture is remark you go to. South America africa and it is Chinese everywhere on infrastructure projects and then very very smart about it. So i'm deeply interested in all of it and please hold your thought because i want to hear everything i've said what i would say is a piece of the three dimensional chest that i've been impressed with is how. Well the Chinese government is able to well i mean of course they're able to integrate with the private sector so that. They're able to use in a sense products to widen their scope of access potentially like DJ for instance great example people have a lot of questions around these cars as spectacular as they might be are they an extension. Of surveillance these are open questions that i think are worth asking. Make one point unless come to that so there's two other things i wanted to mention obviously infrastructure so they are building. New nuclear vision plan so fission being old school not new school at one fourth the price that we do it here in the u. So south Korea but yeah the numbers are incredible when we sit here and say we want to. Reshore manufacturing and they can build things at one fourth the price we can if you don't solve that you're going to re shore something. And we're going to not be price competitive globally because you want to put what they have you're gonna make our citizens buy. From this new factory where we're making things way more expensive it doesn't work like the math doesn't math and by the way i'm not sure brings jobs the job factory. Was a third based on some numbers i was able to acquire a third the number of employees per car output. And i got to believe in 10 years it'll be a 6th and so you can calculate the total number of jobs you be bringing back if you brought back all this car production and it be hundreds of thousands it's not millions and millions of jobs. So anyway that infrastructure things for real and i think. Dan Wong does a good job of saying that america's run by the author of breakneck our country's run by lawyers and theirs is run by. Engineer so when you try and build something here you know the lawyers just getting away and try and block it which certainly when you hear you want talks about why the factory she are in Austin and not in California all relates to those things. So that's infrastructure is another thing that i think quite interesting which is the government may not care about whether not their companies have really big market caps. And when i first realize this you saw what happened when they took down all the bob when they went after jack man financial could have been this big thing and i got you know haircut question will do they care. And if you are pushing your companies to be low cost providers maybe that's at odds with them being hyper profitable and really big and then you can turn around and ask the question hearing that cause me to ask the question. Does America really benefit by the fact that the mag 7 have 3 trillion dollar market caps i know the employees of those companies do. But is that a sign of our competitive capitalistic society not being truly competitive global scale and no even within like there's a notion you learn about. In economics classes called your competition and impure competition no one has an intellectual property advantage marginal profits are whittled down just to the cost of capital and the consumer benefits. Because there's no excessive profit capture if we have all these companies that are able to kind of have excessive profits is that a form of market failure. And does the fact that they exist help american anyway i at first i was of course i'm a venture capitalist i want to think yes of course but then as i think about it i don't know that our government or our society or our people. Better off because the 6 companies have 3 trillion dollar market caps no it's not that many people that like the percentage of the. Country that's employed by those companies is small overall basis i think they have a different perspective on whether big market caps matter and i think that is somewhat intriguing. What do you think about the innovation in china leading in some cases to the development of superior technology at a lower cost. That is plausibly an extension of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the government is that a real thing i'm not in a good place to know i would have to mention it seems like they would have to be stupid not to use. That given the ability to penetrate i think i think it's yeah i think it's certainly well known that they do surveillance of their own people and i know that would be. Particularly upsetting to people like Greg Luciano runs fire and is very interested in free speech. The flip side is there's very little street crime you walk around you don't worry about that when you're there. No it's true also in japan though doesn't doesn't make it right or wrong it's just it is what it is and i don't know that we have this ability to kind of tell them how they have to do it now to the extent that. The why way stuff where their products are being shipped out and those are used to gather intelligence out of their country and the rest of the world of course that's problem. But i think the way to deal with it i'm not a politician i think the way to deal with it i'm more of a believer of the engage. You know like engage talk about what you don't like and what to do like and trying to negotiate that problem way like we're trying to do with the fint all preachers yeah well way back in the day when i was in the station studies major of the. This was lifetimes ago and keeping in mind i was at the capital university of business economics in 1996 that was the bicycle era these old photographs of Beijing with. A million to buy schools with people in their long green jackets i had one of those jackets for the winters it's really cold. Things have changed a lot at the time i was looking forward and thinking i might be one of those people who could engage in chinese i think the way to do it is in english frankly for a whole host of reasons but. Even if you speak the other language like putting speech english pretty well but he does all this. Negotiations when he's speaking in russian for a lot of good reasons i get it first of all i do get accused of being like a agent of the ccp or something even by some of the people that responded to your twitter. I'm not i've only visited a few time i don't know anybody in the in the government but i worry greatly that we make bad policy decisions if we misunderstand what's really going on i agree with that. I fully agree with that i mean i've thought about i frankly am worried about it i mean i would take a burner phone and a burner i thought about because i want to get a better understanding of the culture of innovation that can be. Foster exactly how things are to the extent that it would be visible to me. How things are developing china thought about going there thought about doing the same thing in india to go and interview like. Ten of the top entrepreneurs but the reason i haven't done it is that i'm just like i don't know what radars it's gonna put me on what kind of surveillance what kind of film the black how difficult is it gonna be who's rings am i gonna have to kiss. Am i overthinking it or is it i think you're overthinking i think the odds of 10 first with disappearance is right i'm not worried about this. That would be terrible i'm like outside on that doesn't make any sense i i'm not worried about disappearing there are companies that. May not speak with you like when i was there deep seeking unit tree the word was kind of out on the street that they're not meeting with western. Yeah you know for reasons that are well i'm sure that's true but conversely in the u.s. Yes yeah yeah yeah i'm sure that's it by the way i think that reflective. You know lens when you think about the country is helpful like. Alex carpe was just on stage a deal book last week he was talking about surveillance and he says well of course our tools are used to surveil the enemy. Yeah and i'm like okay well my god the chinese are surveilling us but obviously we're surveilling them to like yeah let's be honest about these things. Yeah i mean it's a lot easier for a bunch of obvious reasons it's in some respects a lot easier for them to surveil us than the other way around i mean partially just due to the homogeneity of. The society over there right you can't like send a bunch of blonde hair blue eyes black latina whatever. To china to end up at like top university's top companies etc it's just a lot of. I'm going to put a to a bit of ball in this part like i would i would say there's two other things when you hit it at one the supply chains are so integrated in china. Down to the raw material level that even if you brought a factory back here and be more of an assembly shop and you still be sourcing there which isn't. Necessarily cost competitive and to replicate all of it would take a very very very long time. The wall including raw materials for staple pharmaceuticals i mean there's a lot there's a lot going on so what at this point is that a day late in the dollar short for the u.s i know i almost promise you weren't going to go into this. I want to know your opinion i'm so curious what are the keys to the u.s remaining. Globally competitive and vibrant as an economy you hit it the one. Which is it seems kind of inevitable nuclear power or more power so how do you do that i'm not sure how quickly you can write the ship although it seems like a handful of people have done a pretty good job changing the narrative yeah what are some of the key things in european in that the u.s. Needs to do one is make it easier to build build companies i think build infrastructure like if you're gonna. Build semiconductor plants if you build nuclear plants on time and on budget that's very hard to do in the u.s right now and the glimmer of hope i would say is that a few. States seem to have governors that want to get stuff out of the way and i think it's red tape in bureaucracy and lawyers and litigation that make this stuff so expensive. And so texas in arizona seem to be getting their unfair share of data centers and semiconductor plants i think because of that attitude i've seen. A similar attitude in pennsylvania and you know where they're like they prepared i'm five and twelve days because they literally had to take a bunch of statutes that are on the books and say they don't apply right now so that mindset i think needs a lot more momentum. That be one thing there's another thing that that i think is important for people understand on the china front there are numerous people with a. Loud microphone that will say they know how to scale out like plants but they don't know how to do any innovation and that's just flat wrong. Whoever saying that just hasn't been there they don't know the facts on the ground these entrepreneurs are every bit as good as the entrepreneurs they are here. There are examples like in light are they built a mim's light are product it's like a hundred thirty dollars a car what is mim's light are [ADVERTISEMENT WAS REMOVED]o[ADVERTISEMENT WAS REMOVED]nsor mementis is the gold standard in creating there's a lot of bs floating around but i choose them why because they source create your creating the purest most effective creating monohydrate available so if you've been curious about creating this is your moment to get back on track or try it for the first time.

All right let's talk about this is going to be a segue to talking about running down to dream and all things involved with that. Maybe we could start with an anecdote from a fellow austin likes to play the bongos long hair. So it was smoke and reek for every once in a while. Matthew yeah we were talking about a short anecdote about Matthew before we started recording with you mind sharing that is i was preparing. Is i was kind of wrapping up the book i started listening to green lights and i was told you had to listen to it because of course he reads it so you get all the great. What kind of affections as you read it but there's a story in it that just popped in my brain and kind of summarize exactly what i'm trying to accomplish with this book running down a dream and he had spent. The vast majority of his young adult life so this anecdotes from when he was like twenty twenty one telling his family he was going to be a lawyer. And so he got into the university of Texas he was pre law you know every time he went home he talked about yeah i'm going to be a lawyer. And he had met some people at Texas that had convinced him that he should switch to film school. And he had a mince anxiety about sharing this with his father's father this is on the book but his father is a very tough individual and so reason to be fearful. You know when you're going to drop some news i'm no longer going to be a lawyer to go to film school. And he builds it up a lot in the book like i didn't know when i was going to talk to you can imagine being in that situation you're delaying delaying. What he finally tells his dad and his dad others the very simple phrase well don't have acid. And he says you know of all the reactions he could have had don't have acid where the last words i expected to hear and the best words he could have ever said to me. And he said in that single moment he gave him blessing consent approval validation privilege honor freedom and responsibility. Call the rocket fuel and i'd like to believe there are a number of people out there young adults maybe even some midlife career. Who have this notion that they should be doing something else but society has put him on a path or just. The way they matriculated through college put him into a career that they just don't love. And that they have this inkling that they could go do this thing or maybe your young kid and you really want to do x but everybody else is telling you to do a b and c. Like i want to help them have the confidence and permission to go do x like to go chase this dream. And as you and it at from our last call i think your ability to make connections and to gather information and learn. On your own pace is never been better you can literally just sit there and talk to chat gpt six hours a day if you so choose and learn so much about any particular field and so your ability to take. Things into your own hands and to go try and be successful in this thing that you feel passionate about i think it's never been better. Why do you think when you initially gave and subsequently had a go online run down a dream as a presentation why do you think that took why did it strike a chord in the way that it did what do you think it was. I think we built a society like nobody's fault like we just built a society where. We love to celebrate people that are successful in a lot of different fields but when it comes to our own. Children we tend to think way more pragmatically about what they should be doing lawyers consultants doctors computer scientists like it's all these jobs that have certainty to the financial component. I think that's so well intended like i don't think there's. Mal intent of anyone in the system and i'm a parent of three like i've been through this you just feel this obligation to try and push them towards prosperity but it's not. Intellectual prosperity is not happiness it's financial. Yes the most people are guiding children towards and this isn't that complicated math but most people end up working in a thousand hours in their life is a third of your life. Why do something you don't like there's gallop poll data on career engagement and fifty nine percent people say they're not engaged at work. This is that whole quiet quitting thing that we hear so much about and some of these numbers are all time low it just seems horrific like the people are kind of sauntering through life. What are some of the keys to. Taking the path less traveled them in this case and i mean there are few highlighted for myself but where should we start i highlighted one for myself. We don't have to start here but go where the action is i just think this is so underrated and people it further undervalue it may be in a digital world but we can start anywhere you want that's just one that's that really jumped out to me because i think it's really underrated but. Where would you like to start in the book one of the things that we tie together very early on is the interplay between. Passion or fascination or curiosity and learning and. The way to be most successful in any endeavor but certainly if you're going to go to something that's less pragmatic. Is to be the smartest most knowledgeable person you can possibly be and knowledge is free now as we've talked about and i have this test for whether or not you're actually. Truly passionate about what you're trying to do which is do you self learn on your own time like would you not watch breaking bad and read about this field and energized by that activity. If you if you are and you know we have. Twenty thirty different stories in the book of people have been successful almost all of them check that box. You just have this amazing ability to gain knowledge so much faster than everyone else you would be competing with. You know and that's going to be useful that's unquestionably going to be useful. It makes me think of an interview i saw a long time ago actually was quite a few years ago but it was an interview with Joe Rogan. And he said something that surprised me might surprise a lot of people which was along the lines of he's not good at either willpower or discipline which is in great shape obviously blackboard jujitsu he's done what he's done with the podcast is the undisputed king of podcasting etc etc etc. He said i'm not actually good at whether it was discipline or willpower but i am good at obsession it's all on or all off and. I've seen that i'm sure you've seen this in a lot of the entrepreneurs who actually make it to the other side and create these mega successes they are just obsessed that gives him a huge not just knowledge advantage but endurance advantage. You just go down the check boxes it's all advantages. I had the opportunity to talk to angela duckworth when i was working on this and her book grid talks about two components passion and perseverance and i heard a podcast she had done recently where she said if she could go back. She put far more weight on the passion and perseverance because she says we've taught our children to grind. And so once again starting in sixth grade they told to learn the fluid and take the cross and do all this stuff and. You know crush the s at's and take the extra credit classes and all this and they all do it and they all do it and then they go to college or how you do it take six hours of class instead of four and they're just going. But eventually she says if you don't have that passion you just burn out. And so you're right about the energy part i think it's both knowledge and you put in more cycles yeah it makes me think of maybe this is cliched in silicon valley gets so off to repeat it but a lot of folks listening will not have heard a which is if you're looking for the next. Sort of technological breakthrough or something on the edge look for what the nerds are doing on the weekends but it's not just a great way to find. What might be coming around the corner in a few years it's a great way to find the people to bet on who are already using their. Excess their free time to work on these things no i think of repettison 3d printing i mean i can just go down the list. And by the way that's another advantage of going to the epicenter is there's more people doing that all the time. Let's talk about people might be surprised by this but bob Dylan i think this is just quintessential example why is he relevant to what we're talking about. When this idea popped in my head i had finished a third biography and contrasted with these other two and i just saw all these patterns you know vc is a game of pattern recognition i guess my brain is developed as like oh my god it's all this kind of. Lock thing where these three people have all done the same thing and one was a basketball coach one was a. Restaurant tour and the other was bob Dylan not industry how this is where you should get career development advice right there's a part of the Dylan story that. Most people wouldn't know unless they read all the bar these are maybe seen the score says he. Documentary but the new movie misses the whole thing which is the pre new york bob Dylan was hanging out in Minnesota. Studying folk music at such a. Deep level that i feel confident in saying when he left he knew more about full music than any other human. In Minnesota and he was borrowing and maybe that's even a euphemism he was stealing his friends albums he was going into the record store into these listening booths. Like he knew all there was to know and had studied every bit of it and he's. Refered to by score says he has a music expeditionary and the people that knew him in New York said he could mimic any one song it's not what you would think of when you hear a Dylan song that he had kind of. Master the bedrock underneath and then started innovating but Picasso by the way same thing. Perfect realist painter age 14 if you go to the Barcelona cos museum like it's in geographic order and you're kind of shocked. At how good a realist this kid was before he went into this other thing that bedrock knowledge i think is so differentiating. For someone to have all the history and then to start doing the innovation what was the. Four and after on Dylan sort of Minnesota. New York City and why is that such an important but it was and just to like even pile on more on this kind of studious part of bob Dylan he did a podcast series for a while where he just walks through. All these different genres of music and you talk about bob Dylan yes i do yes yes you can go find it and then that book he put out. Of the 50 best songs that coffee table book that came out two years ago it's incredible the amount of knowledge he has about songs. Outside of his genre everything so he's just clear student of what he's doing i think this is well known and is covered in the beginning of the movie he went to New York to find what he got three. Probably the single kind of most deterministic and ambitious mentor pursuit story that i've ever heard of like he hitchhike there with no money and found him and became friends with this echoes back to go where the action is also. No doubt. By the way he landed in Manhattan at the center of the phone music scene and all those people he was studying when he was listening in Minnesota they were all there. You know he got to know if that doesn't happen i don't think Dylan happens you know. How relevant do you think the go where the action is now considering the access to information. Using chat to your other tools etc etc etc maybe less so access to mentors you can have virtual relationships but how relevant do you think that is i've got my own opinion. You can certainly have the type of here and mentor experiences that are remote i have a great anecdote about mr beast in the book that we can talk about that was a remote one but. The benefits of being in and around a whole bunch of people chasing the same thing is so high and i think the intuition is. What's going to be even more competitive so why would i want to be better to try and do this in a town where it's less of a big deal but the problem is. Your learning is impacted your access to peers and mentors is drastically reduced and then probably most importantly your option ality it's cut so dramatically. People think that a lot of success stories they attributed to luck but you know is that famous saying luck is when preparation meets opportunity and. When you're in the epicenter both your preparation and your opportunity go up you know ten acts. And so your ability to just have that lucky moment we get brought into something is so much higher. So the lucky moment is i think really important underscore in terms of going where the action is because. There's a lot you can do virtually but let's just say you're using chat ubt you're going to get what you prompt in other words like you're asking for something yeah and i can take you down a rabbit hole. What there at least in my lived experience and certainly i still see this happening when i moved to silicon valley in. Two thousand and then i look back at my angel investing career i look back at all these collaborations the vast majority of them did not come from me going out with an agenda and seeking something they came from serendipitous. Bumping into somebody coffee shop i literally met the wall robicom because i was hitting on his girlfriend at the time when she was getting her coffee didn't realize that they were together. And then you look at garrick camp kevin ros these are like at a barbeque i met kevin ros and you go down the list and you look at all of these formative. Massive impactful personally and professionally relationships they almost all came from serendipity. And you just don't seem to get that density unless you're in the center of the action and perhaps it's easier to relocate yourself i'm sure it is when you have fewer responsibilities but. I can't even imagine what my life would look like had i not in a left long island and then ultimately moved silicon valley. Same for me i had thought about the notion of venture capital and practicing it and probably would have jumped at any job i could have got like when i was at my combs here in austin i tried to get an interview with austin ventures like i didn't get one but. Had they said yes maybe i practice there and i'm glad that didn't happen like going and practicing it where i did. Was the exact right place to do it i do think if if you can because there are financial constraints you know if you want to be greater to field and that field has an epicenter i think you should go. And there are different types of epicenter to like you think about let's just say i not to repeatedly bang that drum but you could just say okay i first thing that comes to mind silicon valley but. It's gonna be a bit of a digression i remember asking. Derek sivers friend of mine amazing entrepreneur kind of philosopher programmer people can look him up but i asked him who's the first person comes to mind you think of the word successful he said well actually the most interesting or more interesting question might be who's the third person comes to mind because i might say. Something really obvious like richard branson but is he successful i don't really know what his goals were so i have to compare his goals to his outcomes. And then you get to the third similarly with an epicenter you could say silicon valley first but there might be something that is a dense and learning but. Has other advantages like i think it's the university of water lube but one of these universities where industry is trying to raid. The academic program because it's so strong in terms of teaching the technical side right so there's so many different ways. To approach it but let's talk about a virtual example you mentioned mr beast could you describe that story yeah i actually heard it on a podcast but i had it. Also got a chance to talk to jimmy d trying to get him to go to school and college which he wasn't doing because he was playing around on youtube all day he met three other people who are equally fascinated with youtube. And this is a virtual epicenter story but it's really a peer story one of my six principles is embrace your peers and i think far too many people. Have sharp elbows to peers because i think you know the climate ladder and they've got to beat these people and the world's just way too prosperous to have that mindset you can learn so much. And get so much value from co climbing that you should definitely do that and i think. It's not taught enough and people don't do enough but jimmy happened on these three people and they got on a Skype call he said 20 hours a day. And for years sounds like jimmy years they shared best practices on this call which apparently in that world like the color of the icon on the. Host you do on instagram to send them to you to like all these little bitty ass things can impact conversion. And he said when he was talking about this that they all became millionaires he said if you are any random individual had been a fifth person on those calls you would have to. Because of that and it's just a wonderful example of how peers you know he he on this podcast said something that was very clever he took the 10,000 hours thing from gladwell said. Well there are four of us spending 10,000 hours and then sharing ideas to get 40,000 hours of expertise how would you suggest people who are not on youtube where you can identify outliers perhaps. I should say easily in this day and age it's a sea of participants but. How should people go about seeking peers and do you rank order your principles in a way for instance. Do you want to first check the box if you can go where the action is and embrace your peers because the level will be higher i think about for instance. My experience in Silicon Valley could have just as easily for something else been Nashville or New York City or who knows Shanghai and just depends on what you're doing. The mentors let's just say like Mike maples junior who taught me the the very basic ropes of angel investing he definitely without him like i don't go zero to one in terms of having any basic literacy or access. So that was like the first run on the ladder but then once i was in you look at people who are. In a sense just getting started at the time i mean holy shit some of them have really exploded i mean they've all done really well Kevin rose and of all. Chris saka the remaining the ladder goes on forever but like 49 runs after that initial step up zero to one it was all peer driven and those guys we were we were comparing notes the whole way. See that's the thing like i would say first of all i would practice it wherever you are practice it virtually i practice it locally if you can move to the f center i practice there i don't know that it's an either or thing you can have multiple groups appears. You have multiple circles of years but i think there's only two tests and one is trust there are people in this world. Do everything as a zero some game and they will elbow you out the first chance they can get and so they should be your peers those people you should quickly push to the side so trust and then. This shared interest in learning and if they are equally learning on their own time in their free time which is my test for whether you actually truly are passionate about some if they're doing that also. That's perfect and those experiences you talked about i've had so many of myself they get excited to tell you what they just learn right. Yeah and then you reciprocate right and by the way mike's a great example my i have a both a passion and a lot of respect for people that. Are writers in their industry and buffet did it and how are marks did it who i benefited greatly from i tried. My entire career to write quite a bit but my does this is a huge share when it comes to his knowledge about the subject matter and. How do you make this excellent book also so great. Yeah mike i'm hoping to see him again soon it's been a minute we talked about mr beast bob dillin. In both cases like poor kids with nothing to lose right in a sense not in any destitute sense but they're starting at like. Foot on some ramen right just interview deal book also and his mother was in the front row apparently works for him now. He was telling the story about when he went to tell her he was dropping out of college you know similar to the mcconnay story jimmies being more broke but you know of course she's happy now. Yet all worked out i mean there's always a little survivor bias but no doubt no doubt let's talk about danny mire because. I want to give an example of someone who gave something up yeah. To then pursue x instead of a b or c so could you say a little bit about danny you know i've been a read him on the podcast i might have been him through you i don't remember how i initially connected with him. But who is danny mire and what is this kind of genesis story of. Danny mire the restaurant so i'm asking who is the mire i feel compelled the first thing to say is one of the most genuine humans on the planet yeah for just a wonderful for sure but he is also. One of the most celebrated restaurant tours of our time he was working for a company that sold these devices to clip on the clothes so you can steal from a retail store and he was making good money he was making about $200,000 a year and this is at the time 40 years ago so. Real real money and he convinced himself he was going to be a lawyer i guess a lot of people convince themselves of that and he was about to take the l set and he was out the dinner with his uncle. And you know his uncle was probing him and probing him and i was going to take the l set niece i think his uncle sensed a lack of. Real conviction about this thing this person is human was going to do and he literally said to him why are you doing this you know you want to be a restaurant tour. And when you read danny's book he did spend a ton of time in his youth being fascinated with. Restaurants to the point where he would take copious notes like prior to even doing this so it's family had a reason to know that he had this deep passion. But it's interesting it's an uncle right i don't know that a parent is going to jump in and say that and maybe that's an advantage i have not knowing the readers of my book. And giving him this permission to do things that aren't necessarily pragmatic but anyway as uncle said you should start a restaurant and he took the test he never submitted the scores to university. And very soon thereafter enrolled in some vocational restaurant courses and took a job he took the first job you could get which was a front office job at a restaurant that was making about a tenth the salary that he was making in the sales job. And went on to you know i'm gonna see ten from all these iconic restaurants then shake shack then i mean yeah yeah and we walked through in detail his path once he made it. Made this intention and one of the variables that my car and i were looking for as we added stories to the book was this moment of intentionality. We want people to fell into a job and more successful one people that had made a decision usually a pivot to say i'm gonna go do this now. And once he made that decision not only did he take that job but he took advantage of being in that restaurant to learn about the multiple functions. But then he set up a tour through euro. As a star places where he's working for free basically. I'm so glad you brought this up because i wouldn't have brought up myself but this is going to relate in a second. I've run a bunch of competitions for let's just say creating artwork for. Like pds slash like free books i'm gonna put out or whatever and there's always a big hubbub where. Folks get some folks get very upset and they say you want people to work for free and i'm like well there's gonna be a winner it's like if you don't participate participate but there's always this kind of shaking of the fist like i use so unfair you want people to work to work for free. When i look at. Almost every example of someone who became the equivalent of danny my in their world they did a lot that was unpaid. Almost always i'm sure there are exceptions staging is a great example in the restaurant world where it's like okay. You want to work at a restaurant where you're gonna have the highest density of learning. And you don't know shit like guess what they probably don't want to pay a whole lot it's actually going to be a bit of a drain on their resources to show you around teach you how to work your station do all this stuff. So i would just encourage people to not be allergic to that and the way i got in a sense my foot in the door. In silicon valley was i volunteered at tie the end of the song i volunteered i volunteered with all of these nonprofit groups. And quickly realize that most volunteers are doing the absolute minimum. To be volunteers and if you just do 10% more doesn't take much i would just. Retail people's water glasses and stuff after i finished taking their tickets for an event and suddenly the producers of this event we're also doing it but had. Like real jobs and i had a job at a college shirt i was working on there like wow this kids go get her cuz he's be filling these water glasses let's give more responsibility and that's how i ended up. Connecting with all these speakers just did some stuff for free on the weekends didn't take a lot there's a story in the book that. Actually hard to believe we profile this woman Jen Atkins who's a hairstylist it's an incredible story but the one anecdote. She's rising in her career and things are starting to work and she has jobs and she's getting paid. She would go to fashion we can pass and sneak in the back door and volunteer to do the hair of the models on stage like snuck in. Like not supposed to be there just to get reps with these top models in this environment it sounds unfathomable that someone would do that she did a multiple time and she did it yes what ended up happening after that i don't know her story. Oh she's become probably the most successful hairstylist of our time. I think it's an incredible story how do you suggest people who are maybe they're doing a b and c right now they're listening to this and say i want to take the leap. I want to do the i want to do whatever the off menu option is yeah they might have to have a conversation with her they might have to have a conversation with spouse and i have to have a conversation with her. Who knows whoever the most important people are in their lives how might they approach that we're going to talk about. Choosing paths in a second cuz i do have a question about maybe how to sanity check yourself in the world of a i but. How do you suggest having this conversations do you moonlight for a while so it's not either or do you make time bound in a sense really just give me permission to try this for six months a year two years. It's interesting i think any of those approaches is realistic with profile so can and book of con academy and he told his wife you want to go try it for a year. He worked at hedge fund just like danny mire he was making real money i didn't realize that about. And i started working with his cousins across the globe online doing these tutorial exercises. And end up posting a few new to they started working told his wife i really want to go tilt it the seat even know what the business model was any you know when change it look i think. The real test comes back to. This passion element or we use a lot of different words cuz passion's been kind of considered right but. Fascination curiosity like if you have. This desire to know so much about this one thing that curiosity so high i think that that's not apparent to whoever these people are you trying to convince is pretty low. Because if you're going to tell that something that hard and if you're going to really differentiate yourself by being. That learned in that field and i can be hard for someone to tell you not to go do it. It's not going to be easy i want anyone to think that just read this book and magic happens like it requires effort and that's why this test. Matter so much this test of whether you would learn about this thing on your free time. And maybe are you already learning are you already learning about it on free yes no doubt at least i want to be you should be you i doubt turn it on. History yeah i have an example of someone who just turned it on we have a chapter called never too late which is where the salt con thing is because that happened when he was close to forty. Another local austin night or tito beverage. I'm started his endeavor in the spirit business i was just thinking about him all driving here for no good reason at the age of forty. All right he's watching a pbs special. This is also hard to watch the pbs special back when probably when there are only four channels or whatever but they said on the screen. They said take a blank sheet of paper draw line down and put what you. Love to do on the left and what you're really good at on the right just a list of those things and then contemplate what might be in the middle. And he had studied chemistry and a lot of stuff and he like going out to bars and socializing and he was making flavored by cuz christmas presents in his spare time was his day job. His first career was in size metology and the oil field that dragged him to south america when that became dangerous both in medland and in south america he became a mortgage broker. In love either of yeah but the reason i brought up when you said like already i don't know that he was already studying the spirit business but once he. Made that intentionality to go do this then he studied it writ large how did he start to take your ass because i was just thinking about him. He did beverage just acquired la la tequila is i was involved with that's probably why he bought the plan but how did he start he first started by just studying the distilling process writ large like. Read everything possibly could and then it turns out there were no distilleries in the state of texas and there were laws on the books that made it nearly impossible so then he had to study that and literally rewrite regulation to make it possible. Interesting lead to the whole thing on credit cards so he owns 100% of the business which is a huge business is the single largest spirit. Sold in america realize that your eyes is that it's huge yeah yeah. Yes. So wild so wild i promised to get to this i do want to get to it are there any sanity checks that you would put in place to compliment the fascination slash obsession slash. What i'm doing in my spare time i would pay to do or do for free some wondering if there are any things you you would take off the table or how you would hone that given. The rapidly developing technology of a i so if someone said you know what i love to do in my spare time is copy editing i might not suggest that they throw caution to the wind and burn the ships and go into copy editing any thoughts. The first thing i would note is that many of those pragmatic jobs that the well intention parents have been pushing their children towards are at risk yeah for sure so so i'm sorry. Right is risky but as compared to what right comp silent from being the least risky major you could possibly get to one that's somewhat risky like overnight. And so that'd be my first like notion and the second thing i would add to that which i already said is no matter what your endeavor is you need to be playing with this tool it's a modern tool. It's the equivalent of a laptop and my software was [ADVERTISEMENT WAS REMOVED]f[ADVERTISEMENT WAS REMOVED]n[ADVERTISEMENT WAS REMOVED] with the best he was interviewing are you manual so famous super agent who. Force of nature is all family is just like drinking different water i don't know what's going on there but. He is raised a ton of money to invest in live events sports and so on as an anti ai or. Maybe ai anti fragile bet there are lots of ways to make money when you raise a lot of my so i so putting that aside. Any other. Ai resilience or anti ai bets that you think are interesting outside of live events live sports. I think a lot of the service industries i think humans enjoy experiences and i don't think that changes personally that much and so you know. Restaurant tours or hotel years like i think all those things are going to thrive and people that know how to really differentiate experiences in that way i don't share this thought that we're all going to go watch. Movies that we've imagined that are made just for ourselves i find that hard to believe i think people enjoy. Great art in many different forms they enjoy talking about it and enjoy the community element of having seen the same thing. And so it may be that if you're a movie maker using a i instead of this expensive cgi tool set i think the story telling and the imagination and. Writing i think all those things will still be real i really do and obviously just general business entrepreneurship i took my dad who's 93 fly fishing in montana the summer and. We're at a large and one of the other guests who was staying there is 28 year old entrepreneur from the tip of Texas down your corporate christy area. He started like three or four businesses and was well off like i'm not saying but he was so enamored with a i. He said i needed this and then it did this and then i need to this and then i did this and then i wanted to know where to put the next one of these and i just ask it where would you put it in the city and immediately gave me answers you go this guy was. Already successful but he was running triple speed because he had tipped into the stuff and he was learning what was possible because he had an open mind towards it solving problems. And i thought holy shit if other people kind of just lean down the way he's leaning on it they would become super powered themselves i was like really blown away by that. Yeah this makes me think of a k! Rose is spending the vast majority of his free time playing with all these tools by quoting using them. Endlessly and i feel like that is probably over the next few weeks where i need to put some more time. And just take a lay up with wherever it happens to intersect with some place that makes it easy to apply who's sam hinky. I'm saying he is a gentleman that about i don't know six years ago became maybe the youngest gm in the history of the NBA became the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. Why is the story relevant. He was a amazing student he grew up in Oklahoma his father worked for halliburton he made good grades good students kind of classic did everything right became a consultant. I think it's working for mckinsey and they moved him to Australia and he's sitting there and he's reading other things in his spare time he's not reading about how to be a better console. And he reads a book called money ball which we all know of the michael louis book about the oakland a's. And in almost what seems like an instant decided i really need to be in sports analytics i mentioned that a lot of the stories we found have this intentionality so that book just like the last laugh did for sign for that book told them i'm going to go do this and. From the day he read that book is getting the job is ahead of gm of the 76ers was about 10 years. So no experience whatsoever in the field to the youngest gm of all time and 10 years was he obsessed with sports already at that point. I think so he played you know this gets back to what i said about maybe you your original obsession came from participating or being the talent but then. You know he's not particularly big and so he was successful in high school but it wasn't you know there was no path. To keep going down that feels so yeah he had a mention for the category but it never imagined himself in the field you know in one of these other roles until. That book kind of disinhibited him and gave him permission to think we know what i could be. Differentiated on this dimension on this dimension of understanding analytics immediately. Was applying to business school and use that as a pivot point for those that have the needs and resources i think in the programs can be a great place to switch careers and go chase. Different dream and there's a great interesting anecdote in the book where. He's trying to decide between harvard stanford which is a choice most human quality problem exactly but he went and told them both what he wanted to do and harvard basically said well we don't really have any programs like that. And stanford to give stanford a lot of credit said you know what that's super interesting we have this person associated with the school that does this will introduce you to these four people. And we're a lot like my kind of his dad you know when sam brought him that challenge. Sounds about right that checks out for me based on what you know the two institution. You know he ended up meeting michael lewis because he was in the bay area and some of the Stanford people knew michael and so. Talk to the guy that wrote the book that inspired him hustle his ass off like i don't want to make it sound like he kind of built his own curriculum but it worked. For people who are not going to get an MBA would you still suggest. Everyone read the first three chapters of michael porters competitive strategy techniques for analyzing industries and question all right. Anyone that's going to do anything in business should read that book all right i want to give the throwback to the first conversation. By the way to back of the book list of fifty books. It's a very interesting with the happens. I think you did the same thing i love your yeah i looked at yours for the structure when i wanted to see how to lay it out amazing amazing i want to get your. Expansion on avoiding false failures let me explain what i mean by that. So there's this expression if you do what you love you'll never work a day in your life yeah right. My note my experience has been it's not always fun even if you're doing what you love. Sometimes burnout sometimes you go through chapters where things do feel like a grind maybe i'm an outlier but that's been my experience right when i realized for instance in the case of the podcast like wow i have much more sponsor demand that i could ever fill. If i just double the number of episodes i double the number of revenue so i do that and it started to feel like a bad job not a bad job i still a great job but the volume was too high and i can imagine. If people take the expression i just mentioned right if you love what you do you never work a day in your life they pursue x whatever that is the songwriting in the case and the performing that is about Dylan any my whatever it might be. And then they hit a really hard stretch yeah maybe it's early on maybe it's later maybe they're staging and so some french guy yelling at the. It's the case of the friend of mine yeah and they're like wow god you know this really feels painful maybe this isn't my path how do you distinguish between. Growing pains better temporary and an indication that you're not doing the right thing. It's funny i take a short diversion and answering the question yes people ask me you know how do you use that. When i was wrapping up the book my publisher and editor said i want you to write the concluding chapter and. I wrote what i think most people do which is i just summarized the whole book and i submitted it to him and he said no this is no good and so then i went to chat gpt deep research mode. And i said tell me about the 10 best nonfiction including chapters that you know and it went and did like a 20 page report and sent to me and. What i noticed in reading that was that most of these great including chapters were orthogonal they weren't a summary they were. The kind of a different take on the whole thing well my including chapters now titled it is easy to your point and i went through. All of the stories that we have in the book and i pulled out the darkest hour moments for each one of those people and included it kind of at the end because i didn't want to leave people with the impression. That is just all smiles and babies and hugs i don't think that's true in any field and i guess my answer would be you know do you still feel this natural curiosity to learn. Entire time is the impediment something that is truly means you should stop like i can get around it is it something that maybe can be avoided something i can get around. I push heavily on the pier thing because one of the things appear group can do is help you in those moments both just from emotional support but also to put perspective. On whatever the speed bump is and whether it's insurmountable or not mentors can help with that too but i think here's better for that because you worry about being judged in disclosing. This yeah hundred percent and so peers like don't judge that's why that trusting really matters also another reason why it matters i think they can help you determine. Whether that is as big a blockers it may seem like but there's going to be some of that in any field i don't think there's any run it's just without paying. I'm also imagining that one of the challenges that i had and some of my friends had. Different points in pursuing film the blank starting our first companies just beginning to invest having a career in x right when i got out college is mass data storage. And hitting these really rough patches and feeling like. You're the first person in the world to experience this and it's because of your unique flaws or uniquely bad decisions and i'm just realizing now i haven't tried this i'm sure it would work. You could just describe the dark chapter you're going through in to chat to you here one of these tools and say give me any. Comparable examples from other people of succeeding another feel i'm sure it also give you five answers on how to deal with it i guess but by the way one thing that's important when we're talking about this is. Then you think has this great book on regret any talks about it as a valid motivator to get you to make good decisions and there is. A reality that that anxiety may feel may mean you're not in the right lane and so when you were at that sales job you got to the point where you're like holy shit i don't want to be doing this anymore. And i had two careers before i became a vc one is an engineer one of the cell site analyst i enjoyed both i think i was good at both but i reached a point about three years in with each where i was like i don't want to do this the rest of my life. And so i would say equally with like don't give up too early but if the signal is really telling you i don't want to do this the rest of my life. Jump out that's the precise moment to move on try something new and i spend a ton of time in early chapters. Trying to get people to understand that's okay most people don't end up in a career that their major was like i think one of the reasons people. Grind too long is because they think they're supposed to they just think they're supposed to stay in this lane there. How did you conclude it was time to hop in those cases we don't have to go into tons of the background because we talked about so much your history. And decisions and so on including i want to say stealing paul pilots but it's pretty good story about getting a paul pilot but was it just a gut feeling was it like a. Just quiet that you felt in your system or was it more than that i'm sure i've overplayed it in my brain but they feel like very concrete moments where i had. Almost near certainty the first one was i started my third project that compact computer corporation where i was an engineer and the projects were these computers were releasing. And the third one was another computer with a little faster clock speed and better intel to but the rest of it was all the same and we're going to do it again i'm like. I doesn't seem that interesting and i become curious about other things so when i was doing external learning which is what i refer to as this kind of spare time learning it wasn't that yeah it was something else. I was reading peter lynches book on stocks and stuff like that so i segue segue to the cell side analyst yes the thing that happened is a cell side and listen this gets into. And i may parlay this into something from the daniel pink book but this notion of do you want to do this the rest of your life the cell side job is wonderful you access so early. In your life to so many amazing people but you have to work really hard and you know this classic thing where you're in your twenties and you're working on. Wall street you know they serve dinner at the office like the cafeterias open up tell you something. And it was like 10 30 or 11 p.m. And the entire research department was on the 36 floor park avenue plaza and i didn't loop. The four corner offices were the most senior analyst. And for whatever reason i pop my head in each of their office and they were career cell side i said do i want to be this person. When i'm 60 it just stuck in my head i went to the next one went to the next one hopefully i don't know who those people were but i was like no i don't like that night that night i made the decision that i gotta go do something else. In daniel pink book he talks a lot about boldness regrets and this is where i say do you want to do this the rest of your life. He says one of the most robust findings in the academic research and my own is that over time we are much more likely to regret the chances we didn't take the chances we did. What haunts is the inaction itself for going opportunities all linger in the same way and he says that they studied this across china rush of japan. Common across all of them and you may have heard of this youtube video where bezos talks about his regret minimization framework. Yeah and so he had the same thing he's walking around central parks should i stay in this incredible job of the shower is making tons of money. Are should i take this flyer on this online bookstore i want to do and he put it in his mind that test which is when i'm 80 and looking back i'm gonna regret not doing this. Well it makes me think of and this is also. The dice proposition quoting nickel the market valley but make mistakes of ambition not mistakes of sloth. Yes right the same thing and i do think about that. A lot myself i'm at a point where i'm trying to figure out my next chapters to podcasting games get pretty crowded. And i still enjoy doing it but that's only because i refuse to kind of play by the incentives that the platforms and algorithms provide which is like economically punishing but intellectually rewarding so. Because you had to successful careers is not just a bycaster influencer but as an angel investor i would encourage you read archer brooks book strength to strength i did i did it was great it was great i think it is great perspective for kind of. Later career yeah i should go back and look at my notes from that book again. So let's check for a second people should all check the sound i mean you're such an operator track records incredible. Running down a dream how to thrive in a career actually love will talk about that again mention it again at the end. What do you want to do after this book. When you you can't sit on your hands very long no and i as i mentioned when i made the decision to stop. The venture career which i think we talked about on the last i guess i read the steam martin but i didn't know i knew i want to do something else and i went on listening to her and i. Can you just reiterate what a listening to is. I just identified several people who had. Kind of successfully retired strong work but made a decision to stop doing. A job they were very successful that and then what do you do now and it's similar to the archer brooks book but it was just a personal. And. A lot of people in jones a lot of people go on boards a lot of people manage their own money i had this list of people teach and slowly was checking them off like. Yeah like i don't really want to manage my own i don't really want to be. Want to start my own venture firm of done that. And so i found myself crossing off and i couldn't discover something that got me excited and tied into this. What are you doing with your external learning thing and slowly i've come around to an idea that i made up so it's not a career that other people have but i think i'd like to start a policy institute. I've come up with a name p3 which stands for purpose progress and prosperity when i was doing the bg 2 podcast which i recently stepped away from. We did a episode at the de ablo canyon nuclear facility and before i did that episode i spent three or four weeks. Calling everyone i knew to make sure that i was prepared for that and that was one of our more successful episodes and i just really enjoyed that. I look at. The shifting mindset around the global nuclear energy in the past five years as an example of what's possible with really great policy work. And it wasn't one person i think you know the fact that steve pinker was banging the drum was super important but. You know and recent and he wanted all these people started pounding that same drum. Joe gabby is wife made this like a big life passion project to hers but it's shocking how quick we went from the stuffs bad to know we made a mistake it's actually good. And that could have a powerful impact on the planet and so i don't know how many of those type things are are defined i don't want to go grind on state by state legislation i don't have any interest in that. But looking at big problems looking at us trying relations us health care system has some massive problems can you come up with ideas that help. Shift these things and i've already got to know some really innovative professors who are thinking in very innovative ways and i look to use my. Financial capabilities to do grant writing through people like that see what we can go do see what we can go change regulatory captures another one that i've spent time tilting up so could you elaborate on what if you're not doing the state by state legislative change. What does the work of p3 potentially look like what is policy work and i think like a silly question but we're at day one so i'll give you what might it look like yeah here here's a question. Here's an example a professor approached me on the regulatory capture front what if we can you define i just for people to do your episode yeah so. There's a nobel prize winner from the university Chicago named George Stigler. He's passed away but who made a very strong argument that regulation is a friend of the incumbent that large businesses learn how to lobby washington and. No matter how well intention the policy is that pass it ends up benefiting the incumbent more than restricting the incumbent and. He want to know about price for that work i gave a speech at the all and summit that you can go watch on youtube has like 5 million views on this topic but i think this happens in the majority of the time. This why is he takes 3 days to get right yes yes yes stable coin may solve that but this professor approached me about making a global database that scores countries on how captured they are. And that identifies the best practices from the country said have the best scores that kind of thing like investing in. That type of data and transparency is pretty compelling to me that's an example of what i might go do. Let me check on that for a second so let's say you create this data set that presents. The scores on a country by country basis what are the hope for outcomes of that that. Countries that have were scored start to model the country's better scores. Certainly there might be talent flight from one place to another me already see that in some respects i mean that's not purely regulatory capture determined but when you share that data what would the hope be the hope would be that you can shine light on. The best practices and try to get those implemented another place in the US yeah that would be the hope and also i think just shining light on them. I'll give you an example it relates to regulatory capture after you've been a senator congressman for a while you get invited on the committees yeah the minute you're on committee you. Are. In charge of regulation that affects different industries what happens i don't even know most humans know this what happens is. Your local senator your local congressman who you think is representing your district now starts raising money national. Go around and meet with businesses that because they're on that committee and have influence and raising money nationally like i think that's ridiculous personally and you could imagine. Restrictions against that transparency towards it like if your congressman represents this zip code in Austin. When you want to know if they're raising money in Minnesota in that little unusual. Will you share the story last time we spoke about being asked to raise a hundred grand donations just to get a meeting with the congress yes yes yes yes yes. Our mutual friend rich Barton talks about shining flashlights in dark places this technology that we have access to i think donations should be on the blockchain quite frank like there's no reason why this information needs to be in the dark. I think there's a lot of opportunity around data aggregation any other ideas that are percolating. I'm in the amored by. A state versus state competition part of it pops into my brain from the china experience in the provincial competition right but. You see new some in abbot you know fighting back and forth and maybe there can be a positive outcome from this and i think some of the federalist papers. Kind of envisioned that different states could try different experiments and we could see what happens as a result of that but it's seeing some of it we are saying so i think it could be pretty interesting and provocative and could lead to positive change. I'd love to see i have this dream that some state and maybe this state that we're sitting in that has a surplus. Would do something crazy with teacher salaries like what if the state just all of a sudden said we're going to pay 50% more for teachers yeah think about the dynamic that would create pretty wild. Would be so i thought it down to. So other problems on your mind wall just present list here from some prep notes we have u.s health care regulatory capture intellectual property u.s china fairness and financial markets us k12. Could you speak to intellectual property and fairness and financial markets how you might be thinking about those intellectual property is i gotta be a top 10,000% supporter of open source. Yeah and this gets back to Ridley's book the rational optimist but he talks about prosperity comes when ideas have sex and just the sharing of information. In my mind should be free that it shouldn't cost anything and it's very unclear to me that the patent system actually adds value i'm quite doubtful. That the human mind wouldn't innovate if it didn't come with a 17 year financial protection like i just i'm doubtful of that. There's great scientists at every university working on problems that are not necessarily being patented and your ability for hyper competition and innovation is so much higher when there are restrictions place. I think the world's a better place when ideas are shared and not protected since the system working with the system we're currently working with how might something like drug development work without patent protection. Here's an interesting thing in a gives out 40 billion dollars a year and a lot of that money goes to companies that end up getting venture capital back. I've had some very open fights with people about this yeah so why doesn't an age grant come with a open source right yeah and so if the VCs want to find a prior yeah it's a real funding. Yeah i agree with that and right now there's a big fight over whether just their research papers have to go on non private. Networks instead of the private ones are on the day i mean they just want the information out there like that's a minor step i would consider a major step and you don't have to take the money. Why is the u.s government giving people money that ends up becoming proprietary inventions that makes no weather to us government or. Individual philanthropists or foundations i mean on some level if that then at some point i agree with that but are there industries that i mean the only one that first came to mind was drug development where the car and they are they all cry the VCs will tell you never work no having the incentive. If we don't have a seventeen year protection the entire silicon i'm not saying i know i just i've lived in a world where. If someone comes into our office and talks about panda we roll our eyes because none of the. Types of businesses that we've backed benchmark in silicon valley are ever about panda he's famous the open source dollars. Tesla like such a bold thing to do and so gracious i think really to society but his point is i was talking to take cruise about this and he said yeah he's not. Things the same thing like he views the edge of competition is how fast you move and how great your products the consumers love them not can i defend them in a court of law and the protection that the drug guys get is so much no one. Can really use software patents to like get protection algorithm or something like no one even tries. But with drugs if i have this particular. Genome sequence all the sun like i get this huge proprietary window in the market is not exactly the same thing but what a service to humanity i was just watching i think the documentary and people can watch for free on youtube and other places the thinking game about deep mind. And demos and his team releasing alpha fold i mean the structures of these proteins and he's like oh my god what an incredible resource right there the original. Paper they wrote was open source open i didn't exist without that discovery with chaffin that google. Yeah open source you know they just exploited it the fastest wild and by the way this i mean not to divert too much back but right now china has ten open source. I'm not a star all in hyper competition with each other that is a dangerously effective. Promordial soup for innovation compared to what we have here. How does even like you probably notice but i don't how does china handle what are the policies around and laws around intellectual property. Interesting lee i found a document online that someone put together a power point about. The history of open source at china it's twenty years old so it's not like they just stumbled into it i think. When you consider that you go back twenty years ago the primary criticisms of china was it they stole i p. And so if you're the chinese government and there's this new thing called open source you're going to embrace it because there's no fault there because everyone's sharing and everyone and so. You know if you look at the big open source projects lennox my ask you on you go on the web pages like you'll see. Alibaba you know ten cents like these companies have been supporting these technologies for a while but every five years they write this five year plan. You know chinese government puts it out five years ago they had a huge section open source so they're clearly suggesting to. The entrepreneurs that the government favors that approach and going back to rid these book and the notion of pure competition i think. This is not an optimist yeah i think the society benefits from that i use this example imagine. There's two feudal societies that are all agricultural base there's two of them in one. Once a week the farmers come to market and just trade goods and then they leave any other one the farmers come to market and they're required to share their best practices with everybody else and then they leave. Go back to this pure kind of example in the book that one's going to be much more performant than the other. And this gets to rid lease point about ideas and sex. I mean open source also we talked about this decent amount in our last conversation but. It can be used as an incredible strategy or counter punch. From for profit companies like android i mean my god i mean it's like you can do a lot. It's incredibly powerful tool i think that using open source as a defensive tool instead of an offensive tools one of the most sophisticated corporate strategies. Company can possibly do it's very hard to do because it goes against all your instincts but i would suggest. That amazon and apple and maybe met a who has toyed with it should run at the idea of jointly supporting open source model i don't think they're doing it but i think they should. Because there are come a sees at risk if someone else has a massive proprietary advantage. Fairness and financial markets what does that mean you know i've been tilting against this insider's game of the i p o market for some time and i'm very passionate. Does that come to the luxury of retirement or maybe i mean if you tilt against the investment banks you gotta be comfortable not going to conferences that's for sure. They are some really nice and so. You fall off the invite. The way that an i p o price is so god awful stupid they pick who gets the stock and pick the price and i've said it over and over again but a freshman comp size student and a freshman. Finance student if you told them to design the i p o they would just match supply and demand anonymously like it's how every bond is priced it's interesting lee how every initial coin offering works. And so i've become a late to the game crypto enthusiasts because i'm so sick of this damn i p o process being broken can you say a bit more about how it's broken just walks through a hypothetical example of why it's broken yet when the company is coming public. The bankers literally. Ask everyone from orders but then they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price supply and demand can automatically pick the allocation and the price. It's not automatically the wrong word can algorithmically like this is super easy like it's not hard why don't they do that. Because they're handing free money to the client there we go that's what i was looking at it know that it's been known for a long time i uncovering email from nineteen ninety nine. A Goldman Sachs which i've posted on twitter several times where you're like saying we can use this hot stock to reward our top clients like they know what's going on and the fact that the scc doesn't. Get involved really bothers me but this tokenization thing is a real way to get around it because the crypto communities already decided to use algorithms to allocate and determine price. Like the price and the allocation should just be determined to record listing work everyone knows how to do it they just don't do it. You know it's horrible there's other things to in this category the long. Kind of prevalence of visa master card is just ridiculous two and a half percent and stable coins have so much momentum right now i just think those two companies are going to be in real trouble within a five year window. I think most of the financial problems are pure regulatory capture like the reason that there's a problem. And just to tell me from explaining this well cuz i'm not sure we said it this directly but basically the incumbents help to write laws and regulations that favor them and prevent new commerce. After we wrote this thing dot frank like and we thought we're gonna make things better and all you had is consolidation banking sense. And if you look at the offering especially the low end for the poorest citizens of the US like free checking went away the poor people have a hard time paying their bills they don't even have the tools to do it. Because free checking went free checking went away after dot frank right so just to please push back from oversimplifying this but regulatory captures not just bad for startups and silicon value hope to grow and disrupt and fill in the blank it's also. Bad for everybody oh horrible for consumers i mean the US health care situation. What seems to be getting worse on a daily basis is a huge example of a regulatory cash somewhere in the past 10 years they just told physicians they can't run hospitals. Who other than a doctor is going to go start a new hospital like the amount of competition you eliminated in this one swoop is enormous. It's just a single example but there's hundreds of them in that in that area. What would success be for this book six months after it comes out. What will lead you to have been happy with putting the time in the state of the while that's taking a lot of work what do you hope the outcome will be. It really started as a passion project and i have no financial goals for what's whoever in fact i'm gonna as we get the book launch on launch a foundation that gives grants to. People who want to chase your dream job but don't have the financial where with all to do it and so i'm gonna start working on that in addition to p3 for me it's all about. How many people do i affect in the way that mcconnay's dad did or did this book did for some of the like some of them saw the talk on youtube from. The u t presentation that i gave and i've already reached out and said thank you and they've shared how change your life but the more people i can do that for i would just be tickled pink i just be so excited because i think. When people get out of this pragmatic lane and go do these types of things they tend to be unusually successful which i think then has a bigger impact than just on themselves. The number of humans positively impacted by danny Myers success is in the thousands i'm certain i'm not counting customers face check.
